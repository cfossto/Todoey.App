# Todoey.App v.1.0
_(Updated version of Todoey. Now with DB and a more modern glow.)_

Todoey.App is an app that you can create ToDo-notes.
It is fully connected with a database and uses
a custom Java server.

This app uses REST-techniques and relies fully on
Javascript for loading frontend and processing data.
Asynchronos functions are used, as well as Fetch.

In this app, we dip our toes into Flexbox,
though styling is mainly handled by raw CSS.

Tools used to make this app:


* Visual Studio Code
* IntelliJ
* Firefox Developer Edition
* Git
* Youtube
* Google


Made as a school project at the AI-specialist training
@ Handelsakademin in Malm√∂, Sweden.

Thanks to all teachers and students for support!
